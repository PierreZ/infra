My repo describing my infra

## How does it works?

tl;dr: I'm using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as a reverse-proxy/web server.

## Why such infra for a single website? Are you mad?

Maybe, maybe not. I'm the kind of developer who like to automate everything. To give you a hint how far I'm going: I don't even use SSH directly...
